{"question": "What is GPT-4?", "answer": "GPT-4 is a large-scale, multimodal model that can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. It exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of GPT-4?", "answer": "The purpose of GPT-4 is to improve the understanding and generation of natural language text, particularly in complex and nuanced scenarios. It can be used in dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation."}
{"question": "What is the architecture of GPT-4 based on?", "answer": "GPT-4 is based on the Transformer model architecture."}
{"question": "How does GPT-4 compare to GPT-3.5?", "answer": "GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 on most exams, achieving higher scores on traditional NLP benchmarks and professional exams. For example, it achieves a top 10% score on a simulated bar exam, while GPT-3.5 scores in the bottom 10%."}
{"question": "What is RLHF?", "answer": "RLHF stands for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and is a method used to fine-tune the GPT-4 model."}
{"question": "What are the limitations of GPT-4?", "answer": "GPT-4 is not fully reliable, can suffer from 'hallucinations', has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience. Care should be taken when using its outputs, especially in situations where reliability is important."}
{"question": "What is the predictability of scaling in GPT-4?", "answer": "GPT-4 focuses on building a deep learning stack that scales predictably. The final loss and capabilities of GPT-4 can be accurately predicted based on models trained with lower amounts of compute."}
{"question": "How does GPT-4 perform on different exams?", "answer": "GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic exams. For example, it achieves a score in the top 10% of test takers on a simulated Uniform Bar Exam and performs well on exams such as LSAT, SAT, GRE, USABO, Codeforces Rating, and AP exams."}
{"question": "How does GPT-4's performance compare to GPT-3.5 on the SAT Math exam?", "answer": "GPT-4 achieves a higher score than GPT-3.5 on the SAT Math exam. GPT-4 scores around 700 out of 800, while GPT-3.5 scores around 590."}
{"question": "What is the percentile of GPT-4's score on the USABO Semi\ufb01nal Exam 2020?", "answer": "GPT-4's score on the USABO Semi\ufb01nal Exam 2020 corresponds to the 99th to 100th percentile among test takers."}
