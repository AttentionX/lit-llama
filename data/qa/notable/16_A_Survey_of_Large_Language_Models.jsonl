{"question": "What are emergent abilities of large language models?", "answer": "Emergent abilities of large language models are the abilities that are not present in smaller models but arise in large models. Some examples of emergent abilities include in-context learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning."}
{"question": "What are the scaling laws for large language models?", "answer": "The KM scaling law models the power-law relationship between model performance and the factors of model size, dataset size, and training compute. The Chinchilla scaling law suggests an optimal allocation of compute resources between model size and dataset size."}
{"question": "What are some key techniques used in developing large language models?", "answer": "Some key techniques used in developing large language models include scaling, training algorithms for distributed training, ability eliciting through in-context learning and instruction following, alignment tuning with human values, and the use of external tools to compensate for limitations."}
{"question": "What was the capacity leap in the GPT-series models?", "answer": "The capacity leap in the GPT-series models refers to the significant increase in model parameters and performance from GPT-2 to GPT-3. GPT-3 scaled the model size to 175 billion parameters and demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of NLP tasks."}
{"question": "What are the major approaches used to enhance the GPT-3 model?", "answer": "The major approaches used to enhance the GPT-3 model include training on code data, which improves reasoning abilities, and aligning the model with human values and preferences to ensure desired behavior."}
{"question": "What is Codex and how is it related to GPT-3?", "answer": "Codex is a GPT model that has been fine-tuned on a large corpus of GitHub code. It is a more capable model than GPT-3 in solving programming and math problems, demonstrating improved reasoning abilities. GPT-3.5 models, developed based on a code-based GPT model, also show the benefits of training on code data."}
{"question": "What is human alignment and how is it applied in GPT models?", "answer": "Human alignment is the process of aligning the behavior of language models with human values and preferences. In GPT models, human alignment is achieved through techniques such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and training models to follow human-provided instructions."}
