{"question": "What is the goal of the paper?", "answer": "The goal of the paper is to address the limitations and challenges of existing instruction-tuning methods for smaller models by developing Orca, a 13-billion parameter model that learns to imitate the reasoning process of larger foundation models (LFMs) like GPT-4."}
{"question": "What are the limitations of existing instruction-tuning methods?", "answer": "The limitations of existing instruction-tuning methods include simple instructions with limited diversity, limited task diversity and data scaling, limited imitation signals, and the evaluation protocol that overestimates the abilities of smaller models compared to LFMs."}
{"question": "What is vicuna and how does it perform compared to ChatGPT?", "answer": "Vicuna is a 13-billion parameter instruction-tuned model that is considered one of the best models in its family. While it shows performance on par with ChatGPT based on evaluation using GPT-4, a more comprehensive evaluation reveals that Vicuna retains only 64% of ChatGPT's quality on professional and academic exams, and only 48% on complex benchmarks like BigBench-hard."}
{"question": "How does Orca improve upon existing instruction-tuning methods?", "answer": "Orca addresses the limitations of existing instruction-tuning methods by incorporating explanation tuning, scaling tasks and instructions using the FLAN 2022 Collection, and using a comprehensive evaluation protocol that includes auto-evaluation with GPT-4, academic benchmarks, and professional and academic exams."}
{"question": "What is the Flan 2022 Collection?", "answer": "The Flan 2022 Collection is a public assortment of tasks and instructions used in this research. Specifically, the FLAN-v2 dataset is used, supplemented with high-quality templates, advanced formatting patterns, and data augmentations."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of using system instructions?", "answer": "System instructions, such as 'explain like I'm five', 'think step-by-step', and 'justify your response', are used to elicit detailed responses from the LFMs that explain the reasoning process behind their responses. These detailed responses provide the student models with additional signals for learning and mimic the thought process of the LFMs."}
{"question": "What datasets are used for training Orca?", "answer": "Orca learns from rich signals from GPT-4, including explanation traces, step-by-step thought processes, and other complex instructions. The Flan 2022 Collection is used to provide a diverse mixture of tasks, from which samples are used to query LFMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 to generate the training set."}
{"question": "What are the evaluation methods used for assessing Orca's abilities?", "answer": "Orca's abilities are assessed through auto-evaluation with GPT-4 on existing evaluation sets, including Vicuna, WizardLM, and the awesome prompts collection. Academic benchmarks like Big-Bench Hard and TruthfulQA, as well as professional and academic exams like SAT, LSAT, GRE, and GMAT from AGIEval, are used for evaluation. Safety evaluation is conducted with ToxiGen to test toxic language generation and hate speech detection."}
{"question": "What are the results of auto-evaluation with GPT-4 on existing evaluation sets?", "answer": "Auto-evaluation with GPT-4 on existing evaluation sets shows that Orca outperforms Vicuna, Alpaca, and other instruction-tuned models. For example, Orca outperforms Vicuna by more than 100% in complex zero-shot reasoning benchmarks like Big-Bench Hard and by 42% on AGIEval."}
{"question": "How does Orca perform in terms of academic benchmarks?", "answer": "Orca reaches parity with ChatGPT on the Big-Bench Hard benchmark and shows competitive performance in professional and academic exams like SAT, LSAT, GRE, and GMAT, both in zero-shot settings without CoT. Orca also demonstrates competitive performance with a 4-point gap with optimized system messages."}
