{"question": "What is the purpose of demonstration selection?", "answer": "Demonstration selection aims to choose a subset of examples that are good for in-context learning (ICL), improving the performance of ICL."}
{"question": "What are some unsupervised methods for demonstration selection?", "answer": "Unsupervised methods for demonstration selection include selecting the closest neighbors based on distance metrics, such as L2 distance or cosine similarity. Mutual information and prompt perplexity can also be used as selection metrics."}
{"question": "What are some supervised methods for demonstration selection?", "answer": "Supervised methods for demonstration selection include two-stage retrieval methods using unsupervised and supervised retrievers, scoring examples with a language model (LM), and using reinforcement learning to select examples via Q-learning."}
{"question": "How can demonstration ordering be optimized?", "answer": "Demonstration ordering can be optimized by using metrics like distances or entropy to determine the best ordering of examples. This helps improve the in-context learning (ICL) performance."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of demonstration formatting?", "answer": "Demonstration formatting aims to design a better format for demonstrations in order to improve the performance of in-context learning (ICL). This includes concatenating examples with templates or adding intermediate reasoning steps."}
{"question": "What are some methods for instruction formatting?", "answer": "Methods for instruction formatting include generating task instructions automatically using language models, bootstrapping off the generations of language models, and combining human feedback with automatic instruction generation."}
{"question": "How can reasoning steps be formatted in demonstrations?", "answer": "Reasoning steps can be formatted in demonstrations by adding intermediate steps between inputs and outputs, generating chain-of-thoughts (CoT), and using multi-stage demonstration designing strategies."}
{"question": "What are some scoring functions used in in-context learning?", "answer": "Some scoring functions used in in-context learning include direct estimation, perplexity, and channel modeling. These functions help estimate the likelihood of a specific answer given the demonstration and input query."}
