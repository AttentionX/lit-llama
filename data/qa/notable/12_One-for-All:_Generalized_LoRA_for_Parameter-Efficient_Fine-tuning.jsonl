{"question": "What is the significance of the structural re-parameterization design in GLoRA?", "answer": "The structural re-parameterization design in GLoRA allows for the fusion of additional fine-tuning parameters into projection weights, improving inference efficiency without adding computational cost. This design ensures that GLoRA can be a practical solution for resource-limited applications, where inference speed is crucial."}
{"question": "What are the limitations of existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods?", "answer": "Existing methods such as VPT, Adapter, LoRA, NOAH, FacT, SSF, and RepAdapter have limitations in terms of increased inference time, limited adaptation ability in weight or feature space, and the need for manual hyperparameter tuning. These limitations hinder their flexibility and efficiency in parameter-efficient fine-tuning tasks."}
{"question": "What datasets were used to evaluate GLoRA's few-shot learning and domain generalization abilities?", "answer": "To evaluate GLoRA's few-shot learning capacity, it was tested on Food101, OxfordFlowers102, Standford-Cars, OxfordPets, and FGVCAircraft datasets in 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 shot settings. For domain generalization, GLoRA was trained on ImageNet and tested on ImageNetV2, ImageNet-Sketch, ImageNet-A, and ImageNet-R datasets."}
{"question": "How does GLoRA achieve higher model capacity?", "answer": "GLoRA achieves higher model capacity by integrating learnable support tensors into neighboring projection weights through a unified formulation. This increases the hypothesis space and, consequently, the model's flexibility and capability to approximate a diverse range of functions."}
